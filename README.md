NAAN-MUDHALVAN Smart Interns Project
Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the NAAN MUDHALVAN initiative, designed to give interns real-world exposure to enterprise application development using the ServiceNow Platform.

The “Smart Interns” system is a ServiceNow-based web application that streamlines the internship process — from registration and project allocation to progress tracking and feedback management.
It provides separate interfaces for interns, mentors, and administrators, leveraging ServiceNow’s low-code capabilities, workflows, and data management tools.
